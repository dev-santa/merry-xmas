Dear Dani,

Santa wishes you a happy Hanukkah,
And sings you this poem at the sound of a harmonikkah,

(Santa singing)

“Ho ho hoo,

Marry Xmas dear Danielle!
You have been a good girl this year,
I heard that on the back of a flying gazelle,
You crossed the Dutch frontier!

The list of your good deeds is impressive,
It made me oh so proud.
I’m not being excessive,
When I say out loud,

Since you joined easee,
You made the R&D thrive,
The vibe in the office is breezy,
Much like a cool beehive 

The backlog is clean, and the stand-ups go faster,
Of the R&D team you could be the scrum master!
“

PS: Santa told me he had a new dream,
He wanted to develop software and join the easee team.
No one replied to his job application,
So, out of anger and frustration,
He hid your present somewhere in the office room,
And, to get out of his gloom,
he thought it would be a funny story,
To hide hints in a xmas git repository.
First hint:

git clone https://github.com/dev-santa/merry-xmas.git


Good Luck!
